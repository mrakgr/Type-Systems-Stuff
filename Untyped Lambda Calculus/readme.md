Not translated.

I did not expect it to be so much here, nor the fact that in the test cases I actually noticed assignment, so that wrecks the model I had in the Arith example. I do not feel like spending weeks just writing parsers which is what would be the case should I go with the plan to do every example.

But going through the notions did make what the code does a lot clearer to me than just reading the book.
